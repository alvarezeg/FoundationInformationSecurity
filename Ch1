What is Information Security?

A system configuration issue can allow an attacker to gain
access to a database containing personal information.

"Security", can be protecting your assets, whether from 
attackers invading your networks, natural disasters, vandalism,
loss, or misuse.


"Information Security", protecting information and information 
systems from unathorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, 
modification, or destruction.


When are you secure?

A system in such a state might be secure, but it's not usable or
productive.
As you increase the level of security, you usually decrease the level
of productivity.

No single activity or action will make you secure in every situation.

Examples of what would put you in an insecure state:
      
        - Not applying security patches or applications updates to your system
        - Using weak passwords such as "password" or "1234"
        - Downloading programs from the internet
        - Opening email attachements from unkown senders
        - Using wireless networks without encryption

#The Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Traid

#Confidentiality

Confidentiality refers to our ability to protect our data from those who
are not authorized to view it. 


Example of Confidentiality:

      Personal Identification number (PIN), allow anyone to withdraw fun from 
    the ATM, if he/she has an ATM card. Owner of ATM will maintain confidentiality
    of the account number, balance, and any other information needed to communicate 
    to the bank from which funds are being withdrawn.
    
    
Ways to Comproise Confidentiality:

      1. Lose a laptop containing data
      2. Person could look over your shoulder while you enter a password
      3. Could send an email attachment to the wrong person
      
      
Integrity

"Integrity", ability to prevent people from changing your data in an 
unauthorized or undesirable manner.

Maintaining Integrity, prevent unauthorized changes to your data and 
ability to reverse unwanted authorized changes.


Availability

"Availability", the ability to access our data when we need it.

Lose availability due to a power loss, operating system or application
problems, network attacks, or the comprising of a system. 

Exampe, 
      An outside partt, like an attacker causes such issues, we typically
    call this "denial-of-service (DoS)" attack.
