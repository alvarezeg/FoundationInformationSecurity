"Information Security", protecting information and information 
systems from unathorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, 
modification, or destruction.


#When are you secure?

A system in such a state might be secure, but it's not usable or
productive.
As you increase the level of security, you usually decrease the level
of productivity.

No single activity or action will make you secure in every situation.

Examples of what would put you in an insecure state:
      
        - Not applying security patches or applications updates to your system
        - Using weak passwords such as "password" or "1234"
        - Downloading programs from the internet
        - Opening email attachements from unkown senders
        - Using wireless networks without encryption
